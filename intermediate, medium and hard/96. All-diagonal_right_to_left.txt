question :- print all diagonals going from right to left.

code :-

//observation:-every cell starts from the 0th row and the m-1th col.
//note :- here row is increasing and column is decreasing.

let A = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]
let N = A.length;
let M = A[0].length

let final = []
//step-1 :- print all the diagonals starting from the 0th row.

for (let j = 0; j < M; j++) {

    //here row is increasing and column is decreasing.(row is moving leftwards but also downwards thus increasing, and column is also moving leftwards , thus decreasing)

    let x = 0; let y = j;
    while (x < N && y >= 0) {
        final.push(A[x][y]);
        x++;
        y--;
    }
}

//step-2 :- print all the diagonals starting from the m-1th column.

for (let i = 1; i < N; i++) {
    // //here row is increasing and column is decreasing.(row is moving leftwards but also downwards thus increasing, and column is also moving leftwards , thus decreasing)
    let x = i; let y = M - 1;
    while (x < N && y >= 0) {
        final.push(A[x][y]);
        x++;
        y--;
    }
}

console.log(final)
